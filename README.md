## Description

The Productivity-Pal is a simple todo app, that allows users to add, store and update tasks they plan on doing. They can sign up, and save tasks under their account. Tools used were:

* Javascript 
* Express
* MySql
* Heroku
* npm modules
* Run tests using nmp jest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work

Creating this app gave me a lot more oppourtunity working with a team, which provided me with another of experience needed.
